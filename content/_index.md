      title: Precision Genomics Suite
      text: Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have opened new avenues to dissect biological pathways at a resolution that was not previously possible, advancing the application of precision medicine through genomic investigations of specific cells in specific locations. The Precision Genomics Suite consists of a Xenium Analyzer, Visium CytAssist, and Chromium iX, which collectively offer an integrated workflow for multi-omics single cell analyses, whole transcriptome single cell spatial sequencing, and high resolution targeted (i.e., sub-cellular) spatial sequencing.<br /> <br /> Funded by <span style="color:#7BAFD4">**[CFI-JELF](https://www.innovation.ca/apply-manage-awards/funding-opportunities/john-r-evans-leaders-fund)**</span> (<span style="color:#7BAFD4">**[Wright](https://galenwrightlab.com/)**</span>, <span style="color:#7BAFD4">**[Drögemöller](https://www.drogemollerlab.com/)**</span>, and <span style="color:#7BAFD4">**[Kowalec](https://www.kowaleclab.com/)**</span> Labs)
