          text: The Chromium iX allows a cost-effective low throughput single-cell RNA-seq or ATAC-seq analysis. It will partition the cells into droplets, which will contain barcoded gel beads. These gel beads are used to accurately track the PCR-amplified fragments to facilitate a single-cell analysis.
