          text: The Chromium iX allows cost-effective single-cell RNA-seq or ATAC-seq library preparations. The machine will partition cells/nuclei into droplets, which contain barcoded gel beads. These gel beads are used to accurately track the PCR-amplified fragments to facilitate a single-cell analysis.
